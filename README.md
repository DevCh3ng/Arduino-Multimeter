# Arduino Multimeter

This project is an Arduino-based multimeter design to measure basic electronic hobby projects. 

## Features

- Measure voltage, current, and resistance.
- User-friendly interface with an LCD display.
- Portable and easy to assemble.
- Customizable for additional features.

## Components Required

- Arduino board 
- LCD display (16x2 or similar)
- Resistors (330, 220, 10k)
- Wires and connectors
- Breadboard or PCB
- Button

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Arduino-Multimeter.git
    ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install any required libraries. 
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the project.

## Disclaimer

The circuit diagram is not available at the moment, but in the future I might put it up. 

## Future

Capability to measure current using AC712 Hall effect sensor.
